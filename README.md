I learnt many new concepts through this app and so I have divided it into 2 parts. In the 1st part of the app I got to know :-

* How to navigate between different activities of an app through <b>Explicit Intent</b>

* How to store data in a list and when to use <b>Array</b> and <b>ArrayList</b>

* What is RECYCLER VIEW and how is it used using <b>ListView</b> and <b>ArrayAdapter</b>

* Defining my own <b>CustomArrayAdapter</b> and implementing it

* How to include audio files in my app

* How to play audio files using <b>MediaPlayer</b> class and when to release resources held by its objects

* About AUDIO FOCUS and its methods which plays a vital role in any app

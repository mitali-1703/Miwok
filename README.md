I learnt many new concepts through this app and so I have divided it into 2 parts. In the 1st part of the app I got to know :-

* How to navigate between different activities of an app through <b>Explicit Intent</b>

* How to store data in a list and when to use <b>Array</b> and <b>ArrayList</b>

* What is RECYCLER VIEW and how is it used using <b>ListView</b> and <b>ArrayAdapter</b>

* Defining my own <b>CustomArrayAdapter</b> and implementing it

* How to include audio files in my app

* How to play audio files using <b>MediaPlayer</b> class and when to release resources held by its objects

* About AUDIO FOCUS and its methods which plays a vital role in any app

## Here's the preview of the 1st version of the app:-

Download the pre-release version of the app [APK](https://github.com/mitali-1703/Miwok/releases/download/v1/app-debug.apk) to have a glimpse of it!!

In the 2nd part of the app, I learnt about :-

* How users can navigate between different acticities of an app using <b>ViewPager</b> and <b>FragmentPagerAdapter</b>

* How to have <b>Ripple Effect</b> for buttons

* Methods of FragmentPagerAdapter and also creatd my own CustomPagerAdapter

* Adding <b>TabLayout</b> to ViewPager so that clicking on tabs changes the ontent of ViewPager or swiping the activity changes the text of the respective tab

Download the final version of the app [APK]() to have a run at it :)
